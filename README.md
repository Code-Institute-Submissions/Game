## UX

The Simon game is a memory game where the computer will play a random sequence of light flashes, each with their own sound,
and then the user has to repeat them in the correct order. The game is placed in the middle of the screen and presented 
similarly to how the original Simon game looks making it easy for anyone who has played before to know what to do.

The buttons are all clearly labled with what they do so it is easy for a new user to work out what will happen with each button
they press. There is an on/off toggle, a start button and a strict button. The other buttons won't work if the on/off toggle is
switched to the 'off' position and when you first go to the game it will be off to begin with. Simply clicking on this toggle 
will move it to the 'on' position and the level display will go from being blank to showing '--', making it obvious to the user
that the game is switched on. All they then need to do is press the 'Start' button and the game will begin.

There is also a strict button which will light up green when it is enabled, making it easy for the user to know if strict mode 
is on or off.
